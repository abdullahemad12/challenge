# summary
I created this website as a test task assigned by deemaLabs. This website allows the user to create an account or login with an existing account. The user is then redirected to the a static page which can't ba accessed unless the user is logged in. In fact, no page is made accissible to a non authorized user other than the login and register pages. The user than can go to the posts veiw page which will display all the available posts. The user can add a new post or add a comment on an existing post! he can as well delete and edit his own posts but he is not allowed to delete or edit other users comments..... All the tables are done with migrations! In order to create the data base run "bin/cake migrations migrate" in the terminal...The categories table exists however it's not used becuase I didn't know what will they be used and nothing in the description specified creating a description page



# Note

I created this website just to domestrate my abilities! It may not complete and the front end may not look extremely beautiful; however, I implemented all the required features that were send to me on the Email
